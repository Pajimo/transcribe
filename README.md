## Instructions

1.  <strong>Do not commit to the master branch.</strong> Create a branch with a meaningful name, make your changes in it, commit and send a pull request. Your team lead will ensure that there are no merge conflicts and your code does not break anything before requesting a maintainer to merge your pull request.
2.  Each sub-team lead should create tasks as Github issues on this repository. Sub-team members can then request to be assigned to those issues.
